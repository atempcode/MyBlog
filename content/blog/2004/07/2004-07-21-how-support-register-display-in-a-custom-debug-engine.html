Several days ago, I asked the questions in the new group, yesterday a MS guy
answered.

Seems to be 'undocumented' again... Calling `IDebugStackFrame2::EnumProperties`
with a refiid of `guidFilterRegisters` returns an `IEnumDebugPropertyInfo2` object
which contains the enum of properties (`IDebugProperty2`) for different register
types. Each one of them represents a register type (like CPU, CPU segment,
mmx) and has children represent the registers. Calling
`IDebugProperty2::EnumChildren` to get another enum for the registers.
