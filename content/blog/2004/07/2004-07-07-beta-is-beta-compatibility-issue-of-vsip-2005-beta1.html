title: Beta is beta - Compatibility issue of VSIP 2005 beta1

I have installed VS.Net 2005 and VSIP 2005 on my laptop which have VS.net 2003
and VSIP 2003 installed. Yesterday night, when I opened my VSIP package
project in VS.net 2003 and tried to compile, the output package dll could not
be registered! The error message said it could not find the specified module,
but it was there in the debug output folder. Then I opened [Regsvr project
](ms-help://MS.VSCC.2003/MS.MSDNQTR.2003FEB.1033/vcsample/html/vcsamregsvrsamp
leinvokesselfregistrationcode.htm) (which seems to be the source code of
regsvr32.exe) came with the VS.net 2003 to debug. When run to Loadlibrary, a
error box popped up.

The output window stopped at " Loaded 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\vsassert.dll', No
symbols loaded." when the error box popped. It turned out that the reason is
the vsassert.dll depends on the MSVCR80.dll! VSIP 2003 installed its version
of vsassert.dll in the windows\system32 folder, and VSIP 2005 overwrites it
with its own version which depends on MSVCR80.dll. Then my poor package linked
with vsassert.lib failed to register. :(

Beta is beta...
