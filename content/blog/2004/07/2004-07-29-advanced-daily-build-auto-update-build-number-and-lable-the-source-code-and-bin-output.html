  bin output

Several days ago, coolbug posted a [useful ducument][] about the daily
build. Very instructive. But it missed some important points IMO. For
the daily build, I need: 1. The build number should be increased
automaticly. 2. If QA or customer report a bug on a specfic version, I
should find the source code, binary outpur and pdb file for that version
quickly. So the idea procedure should be: 1. daily build system check
out the source code from server. 2. daily build system automatically
inceased the build number according to some rules I set. 3. daily build
system do the build. 4. If build successfully, daily build system check
in version information files it changed and the build output(exe, dll
and pdb). 5. daily build system label the whole code tree inculding the
source code and output. 6. [nice to have] daily build system publish the
build information to project web. The information should have the build
output, build number, links to build output. Let's try to find the
solution. For the auto-increcement of build number, I found the task in
the NANTContrib. It can generate the build number according to some
rules. This will generate the new version with the build number as
(month of today - month of start date)\* 100 + today's date, and the
revision number as the number of seconds since the start of today. Our
company's version policy does has some difference definition of the four
parts of the version number. so i make some change to the versiontask.cs
to fit my need. I also need the version number to be in the final
output. After google, I found that the author of the version task has do
[some work][] to make this happen. In Ant, there is the filter feature.
John ported it to NANT. In my last blog entry, I introduced the way to
manage the centralized version info. I can create a abc.ver.txt with the
content
` #define VER_FILEVERSION @NumVersion@ #define VER_COMPANYNAME_STR "XYZ Ltd." #define VER_FILEDESCRIPTION_STR "ABC" #define VER_FILEVERSION_STR "@Version@" #define VER_LEGALCOPYRIGHT_STR "Copyright (C) 2004 XYZ Ltd. " #define VER_PRODUCTNAME_STR "XYZ's ABC "`
We will replace the @NumVersion@ and @Version@ with the actual version
number in the following task: The ${sys.version}is the version number
generated in the version task in x.x.x.x format. The "NumVersion" is the
version number in x,x,x,x format. When copy from the abc.ver.txt to
abc.ver, the filter will replace the @xx@ with the filter value. John
made changes to an old version of NANT, I have merge the changes to the
0.84 of NANT. I never do C\# programming before, but it is so easy to
learn that after 10 minutes of coding, the NANT compiled with my change.
[Here][] are the added and modified file. Next is to check in and label
everything. It is relatively easy. Maybe I will talk about the
publishing to web in another blog entry.
