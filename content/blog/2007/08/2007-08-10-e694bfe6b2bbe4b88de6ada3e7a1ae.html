> Intel’s intent of our ad titled “Multiply Computing Performance and Maximize
the Power of Your Employees” was to convey the performance capabilities of our
processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter. We have used the visual
of sprinters in the past successfully.

> Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact
proved to be insensitive and insulting. Upon recognizing this, we attempted to
pull the ad from all publications but, unfortunately, we failed on one last
media placement.

> We are sorry and are working hard to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

> Nancy Bhagat Vice President, Director of Integrated Marketing
