昨天被人称作八卦王, 今天就真正来八卦一下, 顺便给这blog除除草. 此刻我的slimpro里播着 的 famous blue raincoat.
Leonard Cohen refers to the state of Clear in his song, Famous Blue Raincoat
(1971), when he writes: Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She
said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you
ever go clear?[13]
