One of the utility under Windows that I can not live without is Total
Command. It makes working with files/folders so much easier than the
stupid Explorer. Fortunately, I find a replacement under Linux: the
BeeSoft Command. It does not have same ability as TC, but it satisfies
me for now:

-   2 pane explorer: Make copy/move file easily
-   F3/f4: although not so faster for big files.
