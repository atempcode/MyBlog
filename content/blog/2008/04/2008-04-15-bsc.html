One of the utility under Windows that I can not live without is Total Command.
It makes working with files/folders so much easier than the stupid Explorer.

Fortunately, I find a replacement under Linux: the BeeSoft Command. It does
not have same ability as TC, but it satisfies me  for now:

  * 2 pane explorer: Make copy/move file  easily
  * F3/f4: although not so faster for big files.
