title: The case of application exception when T61 goes sleep

I am happy with the new T61 I got about 6 months ago. During this period,
there is one issue I can not stand. When I close the lid, T61 is supposed to
go to sleep. But sometime, all most all the application will report an
exception and exists. This isÂ pretty annoying.

So yesterday, I finally got a chance to trace it. 2 of the applications have
the minidump generated. I copied them to my working folder before Windows
deletes them. Open one of them in WinDBG, set the symbol path (.symbolfix),
look into the stack trace (.kd), I can see the exception is caused by
nview.dll. Same result for another minidump.

The root cause is the NVidia driver. So the routine steps: download the latest
drivers from Lenovo site, install it; run autorun.exe, remove all the startup
items associated with the NVidia driver.

No reproducing so long...
