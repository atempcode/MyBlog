The Story, Norah Jones

I don't know how to begin Cause the story has been told before I will sing
along I suppose I guess it's just how it goes And now those spring in the air
I don't go down anyway I guess it's just how it goes The story have all been
told before

If you don't try The light won't hit your eyes And the moon won't rise and
fall in sight

If you don't try The light won't hit your eyes And the moon won't rise and
fall in sight

I don't know how it'll end Though the records play I guess it's just how it
goes The story have all been told before I guess it's just how it goes The
story have all been told before I guess it's just how it goes
