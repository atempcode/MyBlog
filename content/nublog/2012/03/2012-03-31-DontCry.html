实际上有两种版本的Don't Cry. 以前听的时候常隐约觉得歌词有些不一样, 我却归罪于我的记忆力. 今天在把Use Your Illusion 的CD倒到硬盘里的时候, 发现有两首Don't Cry. 一首是CD1的第四首, Don't Cry(Original); 另一首是CD2的第13首, Don't Cry (Alt. Lyric). 据Axl在一次访谈中说, 他是在Original的时候, 突然想起另外一套歌词, 那种感觉如此强烈, 以至于他不得不马上写下来, 马上决定一定要也录下这首.

我更喜欢the original one.

习惯性地八卦一下:

*  这首歌和November Rain, Estranged 是受一篇小说 Without You by Del James 激发而作; Del James 应该很欣慰了, 他一篇不见经传的小说催产了我最喜欢的乐队的最喜欢的两首歌;

*  Axl 还讲过, 这首歌是关于 Izzy (当时的吉他手) 曾经约会过的一个女孩. Axl也被她吸引, 当她说再见时Axl哭了, 她说 "Don't cry". 第二天晚上, Axl和Izzy花了5分钟就写完了这首歌;

*  MV里出现了Nirvana 的棒球帽, 套在躺在心理医生椅子上的Axl的左腿上; Axl 是Nirvana 的fan, 曾邀请 Nirvana参加他们的Use Your Illusion tour, 不过被巨有个性的Kurt Cobain 拒绝了;


Originial:

	Talk to me softly
	There's something in your eyes
	Don't hang your head in sorrow
	And please don't cry
	I know how you feel inside I've
	I've been there before
	Somethin's changin' inside you
	And don't you know

	Don't you cry tonight
	I still love you baby
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry tonight

	Give me a whisper
	And give me a sigh
	Give me a kiss before you
	tell me goodbye
	Don't you take it so hard now
	And please don't take it so bad
	I'll still be thinkin' of you
	And the times we had...baby

	And don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry tonight

	And please remember that I never lied
	And please remember
	how I felt inside now honey
	You gotta make it your own way
	But you'll be alright now sugar
	You'll feel better tomorrow
	Come the morning light now baby

	And don't you cry tonight
	An don't you cry tonight
	An don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry
	Don't you ever cry
	Don't you cry tonight
	Baby maybe someday
	Don't you cry
	Don't you ever cry
	Don't you cry
	Tonight

Alt.

	If we could see tomorrow
	What of your plans
	No one can live in sorrow
	Ask all your friends

	Times that you took in stride, their
	Back in demand
	I was the one who's washing
	Blood of your hands

	Don't you cry tonight
	I still love you baby
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry tonight

	I know the things you wanted
	They're not what you have
	With all the people talkin'
	It's driving you mad

	If I was standing by you
	How would you feel?
	Knowing your love's decided
	And all love is real
	oh, Baby

	and don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry tonight

	I thought I could live in your world
	As years all went by
	With all the voices I've heard
	Something has died

	And when you're in need of someone
	My heart won't deny you
	So many seems so lonely
	With no one left to cry to baby

	And don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you baby
	And don't you cry tonight
	Don't you ever cry
	Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe, someday
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you ever cry
	Don't you cry
	Tonight
