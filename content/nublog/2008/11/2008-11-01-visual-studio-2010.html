* VC finally goes to MSBuild...  
* Read from sb's blog that the whole IDE is written in WPF. OMG, do I need to re-write all our team's work in C#? Today, I watched the [TL13](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL13/) video. It turned out that only teh editor in WPF. But rewritten the language service could be really a headache... :(
