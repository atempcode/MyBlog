My Answer:

	Agree with most of your opinion.

	1. I don't think change the output name is needed.

	2.

	I think in the dllmain.cpp, we can add some code to retrieve the
	environment value 'ENVSDK_REGKEY', then decided which registry hive we
	will write to. The code to do this can be be stolen from the samples
	come with VSIP like bscproject.

	3. I changed all of the GUID in the .idl for safety.  ;)
