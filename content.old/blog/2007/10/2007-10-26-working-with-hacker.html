from [Joanna Rutkowska's blog](http://tinyurl.com/3a4xg8) :

> I also announced that Invisible Things Lab has just started working with
Phoenix Technologies. Phoenix is the world leader in system firmware,
particularly known for providing BIOSes for PCs for almost 25 years, and
currently is working on a new product called HyperCore that would be a very
thin and lightweight hypervisor for consumer systems. ITL will be helping
Phoenix to ensure the security of this product.

> HyperCore hypervisor will use all the latest hardware virtualization
extensions, like e.g. Nested Paging/EPT to minimize the unnecessary complexity
and to provide negligible performance impact. For the same reasons, the I/O
access will go through almost natively, just like in case of our Blue Pill...

> Speaking about Blue Pill – Phoenix is also interested in further research on
Blue Pill, which will be used as a test bed for trying various ideas – e.g. 
nested virtualization, which might be adopted in the future versions of
HyperCore to allow users to use other commercial VMMs inside their already- 
virtualized OSes. Blue Pill’s small size and minimal functionality makes it a
convenient tool for experimenting. Phoenix will also support The Blue Pill
Project which means that some parts of our research will be available for
other researchers (including code)!
